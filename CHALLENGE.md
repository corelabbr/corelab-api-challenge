## Corelab Challenge:

You are tasked with building a web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists. The application should consist of a responsive webpage built in React, and an API built in Node.js to store and manage the to-do lists.


### The repositories
The [frontend repository](https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-web-challenge)

If you feel more comfortable, you can pick another React framework and show us your skills.

The [backend repository](https://github.com/corelabbr/corelab-api-challenge)

If you feel more comfortable, you can pick another Node JS framework and show us your skills.

### The Layout
Open the [layout mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/sQrUVHTlyogq3qGdkqGTXN/mockup?node-id=7%3A2&t=ANTOTiqjqGWYuoUr-0) in desktop and mobile version and follow this design as much as possible.


### The application should have the following functionality:

1. Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete to-do items using the API.
2. Users should be able to mark an item as a favorite.
3. Users should be able to set a color for each to-do item.
4. The React frontend should display the user's to-do list in a responsive and visually appealing manner, with the ability to filter by favorite items and color.
5. The favorited items should be displayed at the top of the list.

### Technical Requirements:
1. The backend API should be built in Node.js framework and use a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).
2. The frontend should be built in React and use modern web development tools and best practices.
3. The application should be responsive and visually appealing.

### Deliverables:
1. A link to a GitHub repository containing the complete source code for the project.
2. A written description of how to set up and run the application locally.
