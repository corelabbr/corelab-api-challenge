The backend is a Node.js application built with Express and TypeScript, following clean architecture principles to ensure scalability and maintainability. It handles core functionalities related to managing notes, including their creation, editing, deletion, and file attachments.

### Key Implementations

1. **MongoDB Integration**:
    - I implemented MongoDB as the primary database using Mongoose, which provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
    - The `note.model.ts` defines the Mongoose schema for notes, and the `note.mongo.repository.ts` encapsulates the data access logic, adhering to the repository pattern.
2. **Clean Architecture**:
    - I structured the application following clean architecture principles, separating concerns into different layers (e.g., domain, adapter, controllers).
    - The domain layer contains business logic and entities, ensuring that the core logic is independent of external dependencies. The adapter layer handles database-specific implementations, allowing easy switching of data sources if needed.
3. **Testing**:
    - I implemented unit tests for the domain logic to ensure that the core business rules are thoroughly validated.
    - For route handling, I created end-to-end (E2E) tests to verify that the API endpoints work as expected, from request handling to data persistence in the database.
    - The testing suite is powered by Jest, which allows for comprehensive test coverage and reliable test results.
4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
    - I set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the testing process. Every push or pull request triggers the pipeline, which runs the tests, ensuring code quality before any changes are merged.
    - Docker and Docker Compose are used to spin up a MongoDB instance within the CI/CD environment, mirroring the production setup. This ensures that tests run in a consistent and reliable environment.
5. **Code Quality and Formatting**:
    - I configured ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code quality and consistency. ESLint helps in identifying and fixing code issues, while Prettier ensures uniform code formatting.
    - Husky and lint-staged are integrated to enforce these checks automatically before any code is committed, preventing unformatted or faulty code from being pushed to the repository.

### Technologies and Tools

- **Node.js & Express**: Used for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
- **TypeScript**: Leveraged for its strong typing capabilities, ensuring a more reliable and maintainable codebase.
- **Mongoose**: Utilized for interacting with MongoDB, providing schema validation and easy data manipulation.
- **Jest**: Chosen for writing and running tests, ensuring that the application logic is correctly implemented and remains stable over time.
- **Husky & lint-staged**: Used to enforce code quality checks and formatting before commits, maintaining a clean codebase.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Employed for containerizing the application and setting up the necessary environment for consistent testing both locally and in CI/CD pipelines.

### Conclusion

In this project, I focused on ensuring a well-structured, scalable backend that adheres to best practices in clean architecture and code quality. The robust CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive testing, and strict code quality checks all contribute to a maintainable and reliable application.
